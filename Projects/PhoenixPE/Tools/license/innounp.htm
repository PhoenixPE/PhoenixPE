<p>innounp, the Inno Setup Unpacker<br>
Version 0.49<br>
Supports Inno Setup versions 2.0.7 through 6.0.2</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a> is a popular program
for making software installations. Unfortunately, there is no official unpacker - the
only method of getting the files out of the self-extracting executable
is to run it. One piece of software that addresses this issue is Sergei
Wanin's <a href="http://plugring.farmanager.com/downld/files/instexpl_v0.3.rar">InstallExplorer</a>,
a plug-in for the <a href="http://farmanager.com">FAR Manager</a> that unpacks
several types of installations, including Inno Setup (IS). But since it is not updated in a
timely fashion, and so does not support the latest IS most of the time, this program was born.
The advantages over InstallExplorer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innounp is open source and based on IS source. Therefore, it is more likely
to support future IS versions.</li>
<li>It recovers portions of the installation script (.iss file), including the registry
changes and the compiled Innerfuse/RemObjects Pascal Script, if available.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to report a bug, request a feature, or discuss anything else related
to the program, please write to the forum.</p>

<p>Both the source and the executable packages are compressed with
<a href="http://www.rarlab.com">WinRar</a>. While the full-featured packer is shareware,
the UnRar utility that can only extract files is free. And there are lots of free
third-party programs that unpack rar just fine, e.g. <a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7-Zip</a>.</p>
<p>As a bonus, a simple unpacker for <a href="http://www.indigorose.com/sf/index.php">Setup
Factory</a> installations is available on the download page. It is ripped from
<a href="http://synce.sourceforge.net">the SynCE project</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Usage"></a>Usage</h2>
<p>Innounp is a console application, and it uses command-line options to find out
what to do. For a more human-friendly interface utilizing FAR or Total Commander as
a front-end see the <a href="#MultiArc">MultiArc section below</a>. Windows Explorer fans:
nullz has made <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1122068&forum_id=353235">
some .reg scripts</a> to add innounp into the right-click menu and Richard Santaella crafted a
graphical wrapper for innounp (get it on the download page).</p>
<pre>innounp [command] [options] &lt;setup.exe or setup.0&gt; [@filelist] [filemask ...]
Commands:
  (no)   display general installation info
  -v     verbosely list the files (with sizes and timestamps)
  -x     extract the files from the installation (to the current directory, also see -d)
  -e     extract files without paths
  -t     test files for integrity
Options:
  -b     batch (non-interactive) mode - will not prompt for password or disk changes
  -q     do not indicate progress while extracting
  -m     process internal embedded files (such as license and uninstall.exe)
  -pPASS decrypt the installation with a password
  -dDIR  extract the files into DIR (can be absolute or relative path)
  -cDIR  specifies that DIR is the current directory in the installation
  -n     don't attempt to unpack new versions
  -fFILE same as -p but reads the password from FILE
  -a     process all copies of duplicate files
  -y     assume Yes on all queries (e.g. overwrite files)  
</pre>
<p>If an installation has <tt>setup.0</tt> (it is made without using SetupLdr), run
innounp on <tt>setup.0</tt> instead of <tt>setup.exe</tt>.</p>
<p>To extract all files from a specific directory, use <tt>dirname\*.*</tt>, not
just <tt>dirname</tt>.</p>
<p>By default all files are extracted to the current directory. Use <tt>-d</tt> to
override this behaviour. For example, <tt>-dUnpacked</tt> will create a directory named
<tt>Unpacked</tt> inside the current directory and put the extracted files there.</p>
<p>The <tt>-c</tt> option is a little more tricky to explain. Suppose you opened an installation
in a file manager and browsed to <tt>{app}\subdir\program.exe</tt>. Now if you copied
<tt>program.exe</tt> to another location, the entire directory tree (<tt>{app}\subdir\</tt>)
would be created and <tt>program.exe</tt> would be extracted there. <tt>-c</tt> notifies innounp
that you are only interested in paths from the current directory and below, so that your
file, <tt>program.exe</tt>, is extracted right where you intended to copy it, not several
directory levels deeper. Note that in order to avoid confusion, files must still be
specified by their full path names inside the installation.</p>
<p>Note that an installation can contain several identical files (possibly under different names). Inno Setup
stores only one copy of such files, and by default innounp will also unpack one file. If you want to have
all files that could ever be installed anywhere, regardless of how many identical files this may get you,
<tt>-a</tt> option will do it.</p>
<p>If <tt>-m</tt> is specified, the file listing includes <tt>embedded\CompiledCode.bin</tt>
which is the code made by the RemObjects Pascal Script compiler. It is possible to disassemble
it using the <tt>ifps3_disasm.rar</tt> package on the download page. The result is not very
readable though since it uses the basic 'disassembler' from IFPS3. Anyone wants to write a
decompiler?</p>

<h2><a name="ReportingBugs"></a>How to report bugs</h2>
<p>OK, I know innounp is far from being perfect, but it is my intention to make
the program usable. User feedback is a great way to achieve this. Here's what you should
do if you find a bug and want it fixed.</p>
<p>Tell me what's wrong with innounp. If you encountered incorrect behaviour,
say what you think it should do and what it actually does. If it crashed or gave
an error message, say <i>what</i> did that - innounp, Windows, FAR, etc, and include
the details.</p>
<p>Describe the exact steps necessary to reproduce the bug. Say what are the
preconditions. Is the bug specific to some system settings? To a setup file you
have? (include the problem part of the installation script or a link to the compiled
setup, if it is small enough) To an IS version? To something else? Or does the
bug occur regardless of these things?</p>
<p>Once you have the bug report ready, post it to the forum. Remember, if I can't
reproduce the bug using the description you gave, the chances that it will be
fixed fall dramatically.</p>
<p>If the above guidelines were not obvious for you, I suggest that you read the
following articles.</p>

<li><tt>-i</tt> command displays registry changes made by an installation.</li>
<li>Supports (displays and reads from filelists) filenames with national

<h2><a name="MultiArc"></a>MultiArc settings</h2>
<p>Unless you are a die-hard fan of command line, you may like the idea of working
with IS installations like with conventional archives in a file manager. Right now
two programs support this: FAR and Total Commander. Below are the instructions
how to integrate innounp into each.</p>
<h3>FAR</h3>
<p>Copy <tt>innounp.exe</tt> to a directory in your <tt>PATH</tt> and edit your
<tt>FAR\Plugins\MultiArc\Formats\Custom.ini</tt> file. There are two alternate
settings differing in several aspects and each having its own pros and cons. Try
the recommended setting first, if it does not work well for you, try the other
setting or even combine them.</p>
<h4>Co-operation with InstallExplorer</h4>
<p>If you have InstallExplorer installed (or another plug-in that handles IS,
but you will need to adjust the settings accordingly), you might want to let it
process all the other types of installations but keep IS installations for innounp.
FAR does not provide a means of customizing the plug-in call order; however, an
empirical study has shown that it loads plug-ins and applies them to files in
lexical order. So the solution is to rename InstallExplorer's dll file from <tt>6InstExpl.dll</tt>
to e.g. <tt>zInstExpl.dll</tt> (and restart FAR).</p>

<h3>Total Commander</h3>
<p>Will not work for IS 5.1.5 and up because new versions no longer have this signature. I guess the
version-specific settings from above have to be cloned.</p>
<p>Configuration made up by Gnozal and Maxwish and posted on
<a href="http://ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?t=3810">TC forum</a>. Change the path below
to where you have innounp installed and add this to your <tt>MultiArc.ini</tt>. Note that
MultiArc is not included in the default TC installation, instead it is available as a
separate download from <a href="http://wcx.sourceforge.net">Siarzhuk Zharski's web site</a>.
Refer to the help file for information on any additional configuration necessary.</p>
